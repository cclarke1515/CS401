		CORRECT OUTPUT 5 PTS	 CORRECT EXPLANATION 2 POINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MYSTERY #1:  (1) <951413>	(2) <Method keeps printing out the modulus of n until it reaches 0.>
MYSTERY #2:  (1) <23>	(2) <Method sums each modulus until n reaches 0, returning the sum.>
MYSTERY #3:  (1) <23>	(2) <Basically the same as mystery2, the numbers are just in an array. It doesn't modulus them, but instead just adds each address in the array starting on the right, decrementing i each time to move down.>
MYSTERY #4:  (1) <RETURNED FALSE>	(2) <The value at arr[i] = 3 and arr[i+1] = 1, so arr[i] is greater than arr[i+1], thus returning false.>
MYSTERY #5:  (1) <5 4 3 2 1>	(2) <Method will not return until n=0. n prints each value until that point, decrementing each time it passes through the if statement.>
MYSTERY #6:  (1) <1 2 3 4 5>	(2) <Does the same same thing as myster5, just moving backwards up the stack because the print statement is after the recursion.>
MYSTERY #7:  (1) <5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5>	(2) <Just a combination of the previous two methods; outputting the same values as mystery5 first followed by the same recursion values of mystery6.>
